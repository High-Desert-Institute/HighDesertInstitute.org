# Why build off-grid mesh networks: privacy and security

**Parent Project:** [Cyberpony Express](../)

Privacy and security are not abstract. They are operational: who can see your traffic, who can disrupt your comms, and who can force you off the network.

## Why an off-grid mesh helps

- Fewer centralized choke points (no single ISP account, no single router, no single provider policy change).
- Local ownership: you can choose the threat model and harden accordingly.
- A real context to learn and practice opsec: key hygiene, device hygiene, and disciplined procedures.

## The practical mindset

- Treat the network as public by default; minimize sensitive data in transit.
- Prefer simple, repeatable procedures over “clever” configurations.
- Document your assumptions and failure modes so other stewards can operate safely.

## Next step

- The workshop on opsec is a good starting point: [Workshops](../workshops/).
