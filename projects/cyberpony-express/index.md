The Cyberpony Express is a free, encrypted, public mesh network based on Meshtastic. It is designed to be a free, open-source, digital postal service for the people. The idea is to create a network of nodes that can send and receive messages, files, and other data without relying on traditional internet infrastructure.

*This project is currently stewarded by the Pathfinders' Guild, focusing on resilient communications and long-range connectivity between outposts.*

## Why build off-grid mesh networks?

Off-grid mesh networks are infrastructure you can own and operate locally. Different people come to this work for different reasons:

- **[Community resiliency](/projects/cyberpony-express/why-community-resiliency/)**: mutual aid, local coordination, and keeping communities connected when everything else is unreliable.
- **[Disaster communications](/projects/cyberpony-express/why-disaster-communications/)**: redundancy when cell/internet goes down, and a backbone for situational awareness.
- **[Privacy and security](/projects/cyberpony-express/why-privacy-and-security/)**: minimizing centralized control, hardening comms, and learning practical opsec.

## How to build off-grid mesh networks

Start with the basics, then iterate in the field:

- **[Workshops](/projects/cyberpony-express/workshops/):** recorded sessions + notes on hardware strategy, siting/outreach, BBS/Librarian, and opsec.
- **[Build List v0.1](/projects/cyberpony-express/build-list-v0.1/):** concrete parts lists for minimal, simple, and advanced nodes.
- **Deploy and test:** get a small number of nodes working end-to-end, then expand coverage based on real-world measurements and community stewardship.

## Current Projects Include

- [Deploying New Nodes](https://forms.gle/UZgQiUNzm8q1dmNfA) - A project to deploy nodes in the wild and test the network. This is what the GoFundMe pays for.
- [BBS](/projects/cyberpony-express-bbs/) - A simple, dumb system that works like a phone operator. It can send and receive messages with users, solve the backhaul problem of long-distance messaging between distant parts of the network, enable access to MUDs and chatbots like the Librarian, and provide a framework for extending the functionality of the Cyberpony Express in the future.
- [Flying Robots](/projects/flying-robots/) - Low-cost quadcopters, UAVs, rovers, and electric boats coordinated over the mesh to handle tasks like observation, logistics, planting, weeding, and maintenance.
- [Meshtastic-LLM](/projects/meshtastic-llm/) - A toolchain for connecting local large language models to the mesh so every outpost can run its own librarian, concierge, or alerting agent without internet access.
