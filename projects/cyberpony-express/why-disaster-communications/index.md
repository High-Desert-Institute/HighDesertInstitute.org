# Why build off-grid mesh networks: disaster communications

**Parent Project:** [Cyberpony Express](../)

In disasters, the failure mode is rarely “no one has a phone.” It is “phones can’t reach anything”: towers lose power, backhaul breaks, networks congest, and internet dependencies cascade.

## What a mesh gives you

- A local, off-grid communications backbone that can keep working when cell and internet are down.
- A way to move short messages across distance using relays (outpost-to-outpost).
- A base layer for services like a bulletin board (leave messages and pick them up later).

## What it does not magically solve

- Range still depends on terrain, antenna height, placement, and stewardship.
- You still need power planning (solar/battery) and physical security.

## How to get started

- Start with a small, testable slice: a few nodes that can pass messages reliably.
- Use the workshops as the practical guide: [Workshops](../workshops/).

## Examples:

- [Humboldt County Office of Emergency Services' Auxilliary Communications Team (AuxComm)](https://www.facebook.com/HumCoOES/posts/pfbid02t1mhGpJRvgtjfbPZcH9oBUhXX4tnG4uMm3cp2tiCSBge9UAp8AhNK5o2qjDGDozql) is installing meshtastic nodes on their communications towers.
