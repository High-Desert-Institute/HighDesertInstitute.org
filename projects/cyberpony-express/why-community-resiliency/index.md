# Why build off-grid mesh networks: community resiliency

**Parent Project:** [Cyberpony Express](../)

Mesh networks are not just “backup internet.” They are community infrastructure: built, stewarded, and improved locally.

## What “resiliency” looks like in practice

- A way for outposts and neighbors to coordinate without relying on centralized providers.
- A shared channel for mutual aid logistics: needs, offers, locations, rendezvous.
- A durable communications layer for routines: check-ins, resource status, and local announcements.

## Why a mesh instead of a single “big tower”

- Mesh favors many small, affordable nodes over one expensive point of failure.
- Coverage can expand organically as new stewards add nodes in new places.
- Failures degrade gracefully: one node down does not take down the whole network.

## How to get started

- Watch a workshop and pick a minimal “first node”: [Workshops](../workshops/), [Build List v0.1](../build-list-v0.1/).
- Deploy two or three nodes first, then improve placement based on real measurements and lived experience.
