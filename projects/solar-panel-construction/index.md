# Solar Panel Construction

Countless depreciated and discarded solar panels and wind turbines are available for salvage and reuse. We want to do that in a big way, but we also want to go further.

We are also dedicated to building solar panels from scrap materials, rather than only installing pre-manufactured commercial units. People have been building solar photovoltaic cells from basic materials for over a century, and we want to revive and advance those techniques.

Check out this amazing article on the history of DIY solar photovoltaic panels from Low-tech Magazine... [How to Build a Low-tech Solar Panel](https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2021/10/how-to-build-a-low-tech-solar-panel/)
