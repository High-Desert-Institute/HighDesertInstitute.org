summary: >-
  A comprehensive public kit designed to help communities build their own observatories at their land projects. It provides detailed guides, examples, and specifications for various components of an observatory, enabling groups to create dedicated spaces for astronomical observation and education.

## Components of an Open Observatory

This kit covers a wide range of infrastructure and equipment, including:


### Community and Education
- **Star Party Infrastructure**: Guides for planning and setting up power, red lighting, and seating for community observation events.
- **Planetarium**: Designs and software for DIY planetariums to host educational presentations about the night sky.


### Providing Access To Basic Astronomical Tools
- **Optical Telescopes**: Recommendations for telescope types, mounts, and enclosures suitable for public viewing and astrophotography.
- **Radio Interferometry**: Instructions for building and operating radio telescope arrays to observe the universe in the radio spectrum.
  - **[/projects/very-small-array/]{Very Small Array}**: A project to build small radio interferometry arrays.
  - **Open Engineering**: Salvaging and repurposing old satellite dishes and radio equipment for amateur astronomy.

### Accomplishing Hard Things
- **EME (Earth-Moon-Earth)**: Equipment and techniques for bouncing radio signals off the moon to communicate with other stations on Earth. Imagine Moon Ham parties where people send their vocal manifestations to the moon and back!
- Astronomical Forecasting Tools: Software recommendations for predicting celestial events (a la Stargazer's Almanac) and optimal viewing times.


## Goals

- **Accessibility**: Make high-quality astronomical tools and knowledge accessible to everyone.
- **Education**: Foster a deeper understanding of the cosmos through hands-on learning and observation.
- **Community**: Create hubs for collaboration among amateur astronomers, students, and the general public.

The Open Observatory project is an evolving resource, with contributions from the Astromancers' Guild and the wider open-source community.
