## STEP ONE

The first thing you need to do is connect with existing local astronomical societies in your area. These groups are full of DIY experts who are already doing a lot of the things we are interested in doing, and full of high contributors who will be able to lead the community through many of these projects:

## Arizona (High Desert / Colorado Plateau)

* [Astronomers of Verde Valley](http://www.astroverde.org/) (Cottonwood)
* [Astronomy Association of Arizona](https://AstronomyAssociationArizona.org/) (Buckeye)

* [Colorado Springs Astronomical Society](http://csastro.org//) (Colorado Springs)
* [Denver Astronomical Society](http://www.denverastro.org/) (Denver - Semi-arid high plains)
* [Estes Valley Astronomical Society](http://angelsabove.org//) (Estes Park)
* [Longmont Astronomical Society](http://www.longmontastro.org/) (Longmont)
* [Northern Colorado Astronomical Society](http://www.NoCoAstro.org//) (Laporte)
* [Southern Colorado Astronomical Society](https://nightsky.jpl.nasa.gov/clubs/scaspueblo/home/) (Pueblo)
* [Western Colorado Astronomy Club](http://www.wcacastronomy.org/org/) (Grand Junction)

## Idaho (Snake River Plain High Desert)

* [Boise Astronomical Society](http://www.boiseastro.org/) (Garden City/Boise)
* [Bruneau Dunes Observatory](http://parksandrecreation.idaho.gov/parks/bruneau-dunes/) (Mountain Home)
* [Idaho Falls Astronomical Society](http://www.ifastro.org/) (Idaho Falls)
* [Magic Valley Astronomical Society](http://www.mvastro.org/) (Kimberly)

## New Mexico (High Desert / Chihuahuan Plateau)

* [Alamogordo Astronomy Club](http://www.zianet.com/aacwp/) (Alamogordo)
* [Amateur Astronomers Group](http://www.astronomersgroup.org/) (Alamogordo)
* [Astronomical Society of Las Cruces](http://aslc-nm.org/) (Las Cruces)
* [Rio Rancho Astronomical Society, Inc.](http://www.rrastro.org/) (Rio Rancho)
* [Roswell Astronomy Club](https://roswellastronomy.org/) (Roswell)
* [Santa Fe Stargazers](http://santafestargazers.org/) (Santa Fe)
* [The Albuquerque Astronomical Society](http://www.taas.org/) (Albuquerque)

## Utah (Great Basin & Colorado Plateau)

* [Cache Valley Astronomical Society](http://www.cvas-utahskies.org/) (Logan)
* [Ogden Astronomical Society](http://ogden-astronomy.org//) (Ogden)
* [Salt Lake Astronomical Society (SLAS)](http://slas.us/) (Salt Lake City)
* [St. George Astronomy Group](https://SGAG.club//) (St. George)
* [Stellar Vista Observatory](http://stellarvistaobservatory.org/) (Kanab)
* [Utah Valley Astronomy Club](http://uvac.us/) (Orem)

Note: Almost all of these groups charge dues for membership. I think this is one of the biggest opportunities for community projects to fill a gap where most people are unwilling to participate if there is any cost at all. And if you need to fundraise, my experience has always been that you can raise plenty of money with a policy of no one turned away for lack of funds or one of asking people to pay what they want.

## STEP TWO

Now that we know and understand what already exists in our area and we've started to build relationships with key stakeholders and project contributors, let's start to build what our community is missing!


### Community and Education
- **Planetarium**: Designs and software for DIY planetariums to host educational presentations about the night sky.
- **Star Parties**: Guides for planning and setting up power, red lighting, and seating for community observation events.


### Providing Access To Basic Astronomical Tools
- **Basic Optical Telescopes**: Recommendations for telescope types, mounts, and enclosures suitable for public viewing and astrophotography.
- **Basic Radio Interferometry**: Instructions for building and operating radio telescope arrays to observe the universe in the radio spectrum.
  - **[Very Small Array](/projects/very-small-array/)**: A project to build small radio interferometry arrays.
  - **Open Engineering**: Salvaging and repurposing old satellite dishes and radio equipment for amateur astronomy.
    

### Providing More Advanced Tools
- **Higher-Powered Optical Telescopes**: 
- **Higher-Powered Radio Interferometry Arrays**: 

##STEP THREE 

Now that we have provided basic tool access (moving towards more advanced tools over time), we can start working on big, hard, long-term projects. 

## What can an observatory empower a community to work on and accomplish?

- **Astronomical Forecasting Publications**: Many of the details of what's happening in the sky depend entirely on where you are in the world at a given moment. This creates a huge opportunity for publishing local almanacs and forecasts of astronomical events (a la Stargazer's Almanac) and optimal viewing times. Naturally, this segues into organizing community observation events like Star Parties.
- **EME (Earth-Moon-Earth)**: Bouncing a transmission off the moon and having it reflecting back to the entire earth is actually not the hardest task. Doing it well gets progressively harder and harder.

## Goals

- **Accessibility**: Make high-quality astronomical tools and knowledge accessible to everyone.
- **Education**: Foster a deeper understanding of the cosmos through hands-on learning and observation.
- **Community**: Create hubs for collaboration among amateur astronomers, students, and the general public.

The Open Observatory project is an evolving resource, with contributions from the Astromancers' Guild and the wider open-source community.
