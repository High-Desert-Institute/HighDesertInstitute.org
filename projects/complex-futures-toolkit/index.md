# Complex-Futures.org Toolkit

**One-sentence vision:** Build a reusable “Community Health & Environment Toolkit” that lets neighborhoods measure problems and conditions (air, environment, social determinants of health), turn that into forecasts and visualizations, and then uses the results to drive policy briefs, campaigns, and concrete demands.

## Core use cases (pilot projects)

### Pilot 1: Plutonium and industrial toxins – Bayview
**Goal:** Document and model **elevated radiological/toxic exposure** in Bayview, connect to health outcomes and zoning/land-use decisions, and turn it into concrete demands.

### Pilot 2: Air quality across Oakland
**Goal:** Map how air quality varies block-by-block across Oakland and relate it to housing, traffic corridors, tree canopy, industry, and race/income.

## What the toolkit includes

### A. Measurement layer
*   **Environmental sensors**: Air quality (PM2.5/PM10, NO₂, VOCs), proxy measurements for toxins.
*   **Social determinants of health data**: Census data, community surveys.
*   **Data collection stack**: LoRa/WiFi/cellular, local-first storage.

### B. Modeling & analysis layer
*   **Beginner**: Hosted/local UI for simple regressions and forecasts.
*   **Intermediate**: Jupyter notebooks for regression models and time-series forecasting.
*   **Advanced**: Spatial stats and ML models.

### C. Storytelling & advocacy layer
*   **Dashboards**: Maps, time-series, equity lens.
*   **Policy briefs**: Templates for problem statements, findings, and demands.
*   **Media + campaign assets**: Auto-generated charts and talking points.

This project is supported by the [Lorekeepers' Guild](/guilds/lorekeepers/) (data infra, documentation) and the [Pathfinders' Guild](/guilds/pathfinders/) (hardware, mesh, deployment).
