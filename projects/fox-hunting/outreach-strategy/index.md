# Fox Hunting Outreach Strategy & Protocol

**Parent Project:** [Fox Hunting: Community Policing](../)

## Field protocol: “community policing” tone, not cop tone

A short, repeatable script (opt-in help first):

* “Hey—quick heads up: we’ve received a report of **regional mesh disruption** and we’re doing a quick field investigation to identify the source and restore service. Are you running a Meshtastic node here?”
* “If yes: totally normal—lots of settings can accidentally cause issues. Want help checking your config and antenna? We can usually fix this in a few minutes.”
* “If no: all good—thanks for your time.”

### If they *are* running a node but don’t want help

Keep it calm, factual, and non-threatening. Don’t argue on-site.

* “Understood. To help isolate the issue, would you be willing to **power it down temporarily** while we confirm whether it’s contributing to the disruption?”
* If they refuse: “Okay. We’ll document what we’re observing and continue troubleshooting from other locations. Thank you.”

### Investigation + reporting context (how to explain why you’re asking)

Our purpose in contacting you is to **restore regional communications** and to **complete an investigation record** tied to a reported disruption.

Use this framing:

* “We’re investigating a **reported network disruption** for an FCC complaint.”
* “If this turns out to be an accidental configuration issue, we can usually fix it quickly and note the resolution in the report for the FCC.”
* “If you’d rather not troubleshoot with us, that’s your choice.”

### Escalation (only for clear, intentional, harmful interference)

If you have **credible evidence** a transmitter is being operated in a way that is **willfully causing harmful interference** (beyond ordinary misconfiguration), then the appropriate response is:

1. **Document**: times, locations, symptoms, screenshots/logs.
2. **Defer to local/event comms leads** (if applicable) before involving outside authorities.
3. **Report through the proper channels** rather than making threats in-person.

No accusations. No “you’re disrupting.” Default to: “We found symptoms; we’re helping fix.”
