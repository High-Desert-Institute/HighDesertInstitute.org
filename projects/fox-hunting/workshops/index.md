# Fox Hunting Workshop Series

**Parent Project:** [Fox Hunting: Community Policing](../)

## Workshop series (skillshare-ready)

### Workshop 1: Mesh hygiene and failure modes

* What “healthy mesh” looks like (user-visible signs)
* Common misconfigs that cause regional pain
* A friendly “no blame” culture: *assume confusion, not malice*
* How to collect evidence without drama (timestamps, screenshots, minimal logs)

### Workshop 2: RF basics for fox hunting (practical-only)

* RSSI vs SNR (what they actually mean in the field)
* Why close-in hunting is different from far-field triangulation
* Attenuation + directionality as your best friends
* Safety + ethics + how to approach people

### Workshop 3: Using the 4-element kit (hands-on)

* Pi/RTL‑SDR: what the waterfall is telling you
* Spotter nodes: how to take a “good” reading
* Coordinated search patterns (grid, spokes, leapfrog)
* Real-time logging + map view (even a simple one)

### Workshop 4: Live exercise + remediation drill

* Plant a "fox" test node in a known area
    * Not actually disruptive, just have it broadcast a fox emoji periodically or something like that
* Run the protocol end-to-end
* Practice the “operator contact” script
* Produce an incident writeup
