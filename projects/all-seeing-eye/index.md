# All Seeing Eye

The **All-Seeing Eye** is a distributed RF observer node designed to work within a broader system of SDR (Software Defined Radio) nodes. It is a 3D printed structure containing ESP32 and CC1101 components to perform distributed, narrowband RSSI sensing.

By correlating RSSI bitmaps from multiple perspectives (All-Seeing Eye nodes) with wideband spectrum sensing from SDR Nodes, the system can simultaneously determine where RF broadcasts originate in real time.

This project focuses on the physical and conceptual design of these nodes, ensuring complete spectral visibility emerges from the correlation of many limited observers.

## Note:

This project is being personally funded by CJ Trowbridge, not by the High Desert Institute or the Pathfinders Guild, as no funds have yet been raised for this purpose by the nonprofit.
