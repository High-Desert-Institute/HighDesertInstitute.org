# High Desert Community Land Trust

The High Desert Community Land Trust is a separate nonprofit we will create as an owner of the lands we buy. This new nonprofit will have an extremely narrow focus and extremely careful rules and bylaws. It will exist simply to own the land and administer the land trusts that govern how the land can be used.

This insulates risk and improves separation of concerns so that the ownership of the lands can be separately secured forever within an institution designed for the purpose of protecting the land for the community.
