## Wind Turbine Salvage

Many discarded wind turbines are available for salvage and reuse. Reclaiming turbines from decommissioned sites and refurbishing them for new use is a key part of our sustainability efforts.

## Wind Turbine Construction

We are also taking wind energy into our own hands by designing and building turbines completely from scratch. This goes beyond assembling kits; we are fabricating the core components ourselves.

Our approach involves:
*   **3D Printed Stators:** Using additive manufacturing to create precise forms for the stator coils.
*   **Custom Winding:** Hand-winding copper coils to match specific voltage and current requirements.
*   **Blade Fabrication:** Carving or molding blades optimized for our specific wind conditions.

By also building the turbines ourselves, we gain the ability to repair, modify, and replicate our power generation infrastructure indefinitely.
