# Microgrids and Storage

The ability to generate power is only a third of the equation; the other two thirds are storing and distributing it. We are developing microgrid architectures that allow for the efficient storage and distribution of energy within a local community.

Our focus includes:
*   **Battery Chemistry:** Exploring various storage technologies suitable for stationary applications.
*   **Power Management:** Building controllers that can balance load and generation across multiple sources.
*   **Resilience:** Designing systems that can operate independently of the main grid (island mode) to ensure power security during outages.
