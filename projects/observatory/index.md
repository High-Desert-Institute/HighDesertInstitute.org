# Observatory

The observatory project is intended to create dedicated spaces for astronomical observation and related activities. This infrastructure will support various initiatives, including:
- **Planetarium**: A facility for educational presentations about astronomy and the night sky.
- **Star Parties**: Organized events for community members to gather and observe celestial objects together.
- **Radio Interferometry**: A setup for advanced astronomical observations using radio waves, allowing for high-resolution imaging of celestial phenomena.

The observatory will serve as a hub for both educational and research activities, fostering a deeper understanding of astronomy within the community. It will also provide opportunities for collaboration among enthusiasts and professionals in the field.

The observatory project is currently in the planning stages, with future developments aimed at securing funding, selecting appropriate locations, and designing the necessary infrastructure to support these activities.
