### Endangered Species Gardens

<img src="/assets/images/floramancers.jpg" alt="Floramancers" class="photo">

We are cultivating endangered species such as Giant Saguaro and Joshua Tree in order to plant these at future land projects such as [Sky Spring](/outposts/sky-spring/) and [The People's Winter Palace](/outposts/peoples-winter-palace).

Here is what the baby Saguaros look like as of 2025-04-09...

The Joshua trees are still in the seedling stage. Their roots are reaching deep, but the leaves have not yet emerged; just like the land project they will someday call home.
