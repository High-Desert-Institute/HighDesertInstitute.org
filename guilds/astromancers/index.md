#### Cosmic Gravity Wave Observatory
By observing reference signals from pulsars, quasars, and other cosmic sources in three dimensions, we can observe the intersection of gravity waves propagating across our line of sight to these sources, mapping the propagation of gravity waves across the interstellar medium.

#### Cosmic Cartography and Chronography
A biproduct of the cosmic gravity wave interferometry approach is that it also tells you exactly when and where you are.
