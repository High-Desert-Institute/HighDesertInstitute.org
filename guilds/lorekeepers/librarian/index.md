# Lorekeepers' Guild: The Librarian

<img src="/assets/images/librarian.gif" alt="The Librarian" class="photo">

The librarian is a free, open-source, digital librarian to help you find what you need and answer complex questions.

The idea is to build a simple RAG pipeline that lets a small LLM run on an edge device like a Raspberry Pi in order to answer complex questions based on the contents of the library. This means, communities can add contents to the library and the librarian will be able to answer questions based on that content.
