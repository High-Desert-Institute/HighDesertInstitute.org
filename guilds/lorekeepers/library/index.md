# Lorekeepers' Guild

HDI will publish a vast, free, open-source library containing everything we learn as well as many other sources we have collected on the topic of how to live off-grid well. This idea started as a request from one of the communities our team helped build in the past; to enable off-grid communities to host their own private internet with libraries of useful knowledge. This library will be completely free and open to anyone and everyone.

## Current Projects:

- **[The Library](/guilds/lorekeepers/library):** A vast, free, digital, public library of vital knowledge.  
- **[The Librarian](/guilds/lorekeepers/librarian):** A free, open-source, digital librarian to help you find what you need and answer complex questions.  
- **[The Cyberpony Express](/guilds/lorekeepers/cyberpony-express):** A free, encrypted, public mesh network based on Meshtastic.
