## [Lorekeepers' Guild](/guilds/lorekeepers/) - [Cyberpony Express](/guilds/lorekeepers/cyberpony-express/)

<img src="/assets/images/cyberpony-express.jpg" alt="The Cyberpony Express" class="photo">

The Cyberpony Express is a free, encrypted, public mesh network based on Meshtastic. It is designed to be a free, open-source, digital postal service for the people. The idea is to create a network of nodes that can send and receive messages, files, and other data without relying on traditional internet infrastructure.


## Current Projects Include

- [Operating Nodes](/guilds/lorekeepers/cyberpony-express/nodes/) - A list/map of the nodes we've currently deployed. Includes links to the socials, website, gofundme, contact info, etc for the place where the node is hosted.
- [Deploying New Nodes](https://forms.gle/UZgQiUNzm8q1dmNfA) - A project to deploy nodes in the wild and test the network. This is what the GoFundMe pays for.
- [BBS](/guilds/lorekeepers/cyberpony-express/bbs/) - A simple, dumb system that works like a phone operator. It can send and receive messages with users, solve the backhaul problem of long-distance messaging between distant parts of the network, enable access to MUDs and chatbots like the Librarian, and provide a framework for extending the functionality of the Cyberpony Express in the future.
- [Flying Robots](/guilds/lorekeepers/cyberpony-express/flying-robots/) - Low-cost quadcopters coordinated over the mesh to handle tasks like observation, pest deterrence, and deliveries.
 - [Flying Robots](/guilds/lorekeepers/cyberpony-express/flying-robots/) - Low-cost quadcopters and solar electric boats coordinated over the mesh to handle tasks like observation, pest deterrence, deliveries, and waterway maintenance.
