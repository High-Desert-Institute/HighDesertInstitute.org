# Lorekeepers' Guild: The Cyberpony Express

<img src="/assets/images/cyberpony-express.jpg" alt="The Cyberpony Express" class="photo">

The Cyberpony Express is a free, encrypted, public mesh network based on Meshtastic. It is designed to be a free, open-source, digital postal service for the people. The idea is to create a network of nodes that can send and receive messages, files, and other data without relying on traditional internet infrastructure.
