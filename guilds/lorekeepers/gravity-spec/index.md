# 🌌 Gravity: An Open Specification for Composable, Logic-Driven, Procedural Interfaces

## 🧽 Summary

**Gravity** is an open specification and architectural pattern for building self-organizing, logic-based visual interfaces. It enables both human users and LLM agents to collaboratively construct, manipulate, and explore complex workflows, logic graphs, and data flows using a consistent, composable, and declarative structure.

At its core, Gravity proposes a **procedural, top-down visual language** where every representation of a workflow is:

* **Deterministic** (the same layout for the same logic),
* **Composable** (modules can be abstracted and reused like functions),
* **Manipulable by humans and AIs alike** (via the Model Context Protocol).

## 🧠 Philosophy

> “The enemy’s gate is down.” – *Ender’s Game*

Just as Ender reconceptualized direction to master 3D space, Gravity reorients how we visualize logic and data. Rather than a horizontal sprawl or flat form-based systems, Gravity treats workflows as **cascading flows**—from **cause** to **effect**, from **input** to **output**, from **abstraction** to **consequence**.

This top-down, gravity-driven view enhances:

* Human intuitiveness
* Logical traceability
* Visual consistency
* Composability of components

> However, "top-down" refers to layout convention, not necessarily the direction of execution. Flows may propagate in any direction, and backward links (e.g., for training, feedback, or correction) are supported.

---

## 🛡️ Core Concepts

### 1. **Nodes and Graphs**

* Every workflow is a **graph** made of **nodes** and **edges**.
* Nodes can represent:

  * Functions
  * Data sources/sinks
  * Operations
  * UI elements
  * Reactive observers
  * Assertions and constraints
* Nodes support **many-to-many** relationships for both inputs and outputs.
* Inputs and outputs can be of any type: scalar, string, JSON object, structured blob, function, or undefined.
* Cycles (loops) and back-propagation paths are supported.
* Each node contains:

  ```json
  {
    "id": "uuid",
    "type": "transform|data|module|ui|logic|assert|feedback",
    "interfaces": {
      "provides": ["temperatureData", "statusFlag"],
      "consumes": ["location", "powerSignal"]
    },
    "metadata": {
      "semanticTag": "math",
      "displayName": "Sum",
      "epistemic": {"source": "sensorA", "certainty": 0.98},
      "ethical": {"bias": "low", "owner": "teamA"}
    }
  }
  ```

### 2. **Procedural Layout Engine**

* Gravity-compliant UIs use a layout engine where:

  * Visual layout is **deterministic** based on graph structure and metadata.
  * Layouts reflect **semantic meaning**: causal depth, groupings, domains.
  * Flow direction is customizable; default is top-down for readability.
  * Changes to the graph always result in **predictable spatial updates**.
  * Layouts can be generated by grammar rules such as:

    * Group by semantic tag
    * Align by causal phase
    * Position based on signal direction
* Users and LLMs can trigger layout recalculations using exposed commands.

### 3. **Encapsulation & Composition**

* Any subset of nodes can be **encapsulated** into a single "module" node.
* Modules:

  * Retain **external ports** with preserved spatial I/O positioning
  * Are recursively explorable ("open" to view internal structure)
  * Support symbolic reference and reuse
  * Define clear **namespaces** and scoped local logic

### 4. **Reactivity, Feedback & State**

* Graphs can be **reactive**, meaning inputs can propagate values through the system in real time.
* Nodes may subscribe to changes and recompute automatically.
* Feedback and back-propagation paths allow training and correction.
* This supports simulations, learning systems, control systems, and dynamic rebalancing.
* Future extensions include event queues, debouncing, time windows, and adaptive loops.

### 5. **Multiple Views and Scopes**

* Graphs can be filtered and rendered from different perspectives:

  * User-specific views
  * Semantic zoom levels
  * Abstract vs. concrete representations
* Support for **scoped variables**, **internal aliases**, and **subgraph overlays**.

### 6. **Assertions, Guards, Validation & Error Handling**

* Nodes can contain **assertions** that must be true for propagation or evaluation to continue.
* Validation and assertions may enforce:

  * Type or structure constraints
  * Value ranges or relationships
  * Expected invariants
  * Input structure conformity and required fields
  * Default values and type fallback behaviors
* Useful for unit testing, validation, symbolic logic, and domain constraints. Every node must include a boilerplate validation layer that:
* Verifies inputs before use
* Provides clearly defined error-handling branches
* Includes both expected and exceptional code paths

This validation layer should be:

* Represented visually as a separate layer or toggleable view
* Editable by users and accessible to LLMs for review, suggestion, and debugging
* Auditable, with logs and traceability of failure modes

This follows principles adapted from high-assurance systems such as the NASA coding guidelines, ensuring reliability, predictability, and defensive design patterns.

### 7. **Meaningful Metadata & Ontology**

* Nodes and edges may carry:

  * **Epistemic tags**: confidence, source, derivation history
  * **Ethical tags**: fairness, impact, ownership, auditability
  * **Goal orientation**: optimization, observation, classification
* Gravity encourages explicit modeling of **what things mean**, not just what they do.

### 8. **Human-AI Collaboration as a First-Class Feature**

* Gravity is designed to be used collaboratively with LLM agents.
* Agents can:

  * Suggest graph rewrites
  * Preview speculative branches
  * Justify changes in natural language
  * Provide guided reasoning paths or ask clarifying questions

## 🧪 Interaction Model

### Example: Natural-Language to Action via LLM + MCP

> **User**: “Group the data sources at the top and collapse the math steps into a single module.”

→ **LLM** (via MCP):

```json
[
  { "method": "groupBy", "params": { "attribute": "source" } },
  { "method": "encapsulateNodes", "params": { "ids": ["node3", "node4", "node5"] } },
  { "method": "applyLayout" }
]
```

→ The UI re-renders with grouped and encapsulated views, matching deterministic layout rules.

## 🔐 Security & Trust

* Gravity specifies the use of **MCP Guardian**, **prompt injection protections**, and **method whitelists** for safe LLM interaction.
* Every layout and interaction request is auditable and repeatable.

## 🧹 Applications

* Visual programming environments (low/no-code)
* Data pipeline designers
* AI planning tools
* Complex UI workflow builders
* Education platforms for teaching logic and systems thinking
* Real-time simulation systems
* Semantic data annotation tools
* Feedback loops and adaptive logic systems
