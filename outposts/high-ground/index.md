## Mission

High Ground is our first outpost — a model desert dwelling focused on producing open-source blueprints for off-grid housing.

We’re aiming to create the **most accessible, affordable, and up-to-code off-grid house** possible, and publish all our designs for free.

## Goals

- Demonstrate build techniques for desert climates
- Design low-cost, code-compliant homes
- Train volunteers in off-grid construction
- Publish everything open-source
