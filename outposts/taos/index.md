# 🌀 Taos 🌄  
_Taos, New Mexico_

A high desert mecca for off-grid architecture, creative self-reliance, and Indigenous solidarity — Taos is home to Earthships, mutual aid, and deep ancestral knowledge. The convergence of Indigenous traditions, sustainability pioneers, and radical cultural expression makes Taos a natural location for an HDI outpost committed to collaboration, experimentation, and grounded resilience.
