# 🛰️ Slab City

An off-grid cultural crossroads deep in the Sonoran Desert — Slab City offers a one-of-a-kind site for experimental infrastructure and radical collaboration. With a long history of autonomous living and DIY innovation, it's a natural place for HDI to explore and prototype next-gen mutual aid infrastructure in one of the harshest climates in North America.
