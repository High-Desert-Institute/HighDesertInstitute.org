# Lore Style Guide

This document outlines the standards for creating new lore entries for the High Desert Institute. Our lore serves to ground the technical and social projects of the Institute in a cohesive narrative context.

## Tone and Voice

*   **Retrospective Futurism:** Write about current events (and the near future) in the **past tense**, as if looking back from a post-collapse or stabilized future era. This creates critical distance and a sense of inevitability.
*   **Sociological Lens:** Focus on systems, incentives, class dynamics, and power structures rather than "great man" history. Analyze how technology shapes society, not just how it works. Mentioning specific living individuals should not be necessary.
*   **Aesthetics:** Use the themes, terms, metaphors, and arguments of the cyberpunk, steampunk, and solarpunk genres. 
    - The world is high-tech and low-life. 
    - Power is corporate and fragmented.
    - The street finds its own use for things; people in limninal spaces use technology in unexpected and unplanned-for ways to carve out a niche and survive the collapse.

### Key Influences & Lexicon

## Structure

Every lore entry must follow this structure:

1.  **Frontmatter:**
    *   `layout: lore`
    *   `title`: Clear and descriptive.
    *   `slug`: Kebab-case version of the title.
    *   `summary`: A one-sentence hook that appears in lists.

2.  **Core Definition:** Start with a clear definition or "Core Pattern" that explains what the subject is.

3.  **Key Characteristics:** Use bullet points to break down complex ideas (e.g., "Sovereignty model," "Primary terrain").

4.  **Context:** Explain how this piece of lore fits into the broader history (e.g., "End-state / Transition Driver").

## Formatting

*   **Headings:** Use H2 (`##`) for main sections.
*   **Emphasis:** Use **bold** for key terms and *italics* for emphasis.
*   **Links:** Link to other lore pages using the format `[Link Text](/lore/slug/)`.
