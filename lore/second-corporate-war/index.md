# Corporate War II: Banana-Republic
*(approx. 1890–1970)*

**Core pattern:** firms don’t need to *be* states; they can **capture** them.

* **Sovereignty model:** “a flag over the plantation, a contract over the government.”
* **Primary terrain:** land concessions, rail, ports, mines, oil fields, customs houses.
* **Weapons:** coups, private security, debt leverage, bribery, client regimes, “stabilization” interventions.

## What makes it a corporate war

* **The corporation is the strategic actor; the state becomes a proxy:** Governments in resource-rich nations were often installed or toppled based on the needs of foreign corporations (e.g., United Fruit Company).
* **Violence is deniable and outsourced:** Use of contractors, militias, and "security" forces to suppress labor and protect assets, often with the tacit backing of the corporation's home state.
* **Victory = durable concession rights + compliant governance:** The aim was a stable environment for extraction with minimal taxes or regulation.

## End-state / Transition Driver
Mass politics, decolonization, and the rise of formal international institutions changed the legitimacy game. Capital shifted from direct territorial control to rules, finance, and supply chains.

## Major Battles

### The 1954 Guatemalan Coup
*Regime Change as Customer Service*
*   **Major Belligerents:** United Fruit Company (via CIA/US State Dept) vs. President Jacobo Árbenz.
*   **Stakes / Terrain:** Land reform policies that threatened uncultivated corporate holdings and the monopoly on transport infrastructure.
*   **What Happened:** UFC lobbied the US government, framing land reform as "communism." The CIA launched Operation PBSUCCESS to depose the democratically elected government.
*   **Outcome:** Installation of a military dictatorship friendly to corporate interests; reversal of land reforms.
*   **Strategic Consequences:** Perfected the playbook for corporate-state symbiosis, where private interests direct national intelligence agencies to secure foreign markets.

### The Congo Crisis / Katanga Secession (1960)
*Resource Secession*
*   **Major Belligerents:** Union Minière du Haut-Katanga vs. Patrice Lumumba / The Congolese State.
*   **Stakes / Terrain:** The copper and uranium mines of the Katanga province.
*   **What Happened:** When Congo gained independence, the mining corporation supported the secession of the mineral-rich Katanga province to avoid nationalization.
*   **Outcome:** The assassination of Prime Minister Lumumba and years of civil war, ending with the mines remaining in Western corporate/financial orbits.
*   **Strategic Consequences:** Demonstrated that corporations would fracture nations to protect their assets.

### The Seven Sisters vs. OPEC (1960s–70s)
*Cartel vs. Cartel*
*   **Major Belligerents:** The "Seven Sisters" Oil Majors vs. Oil Producing Nations.
*   **Stakes / Terrain:** Control over global oil pricing and production quotas.
*   **What Happened:** For decades, the Seven Sisters set prices unilaterally. Producer nations formed OPEC to reclaim sovereignty over their resources.
*   **Outcome:** The 1973 Oil Crisis shifted pricing power from the corporate cartel to the state cartel.
*   **Strategic Consequences:** Marked the beginning of the end for direct corporate resource sovereignty, pushing firms toward the "Neoliberal" model of controlling the supply chain rather than the wellhead.
