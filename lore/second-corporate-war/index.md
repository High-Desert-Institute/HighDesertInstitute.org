# Corporate War II: Banana-Republic

**Core pattern:** firms don’t need to *be* states; they can **capture** them.

* **Sovereignty model:** “a flag over the plantation, a contract over the government.”
* **Primary terrain:** land concessions, rail, ports, mines, oil fields, customs houses.
* **Weapons:** coups, private security, debt leverage, bribery, client regimes, “stabilization” interventions.

## What makes it a corporate war

* **The corporation is the strategic actor; the state becomes a proxy:** Governments in resource-rich nations were often installed or toppled based on the needs of foreign corporations (e.g., United Fruit Company).
* **Violence is deniable and outsourced:** Use of contractors, militias, and "security" forces to suppress labor and protect assets, often with the tacit backing of the corporation's home state.
* **Victory = durable concession rights + compliant governance:** The aim was a stable environment for extraction with minimal taxes or regulation.

## End-state / Transition Driver
Mass politics, decolonization, and the rise of formal international institutions changed the legitimacy game. Capital shifted from direct territorial control to rules, finance, and supply chains.
