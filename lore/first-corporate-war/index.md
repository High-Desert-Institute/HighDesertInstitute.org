# Corporate War I: Charter-Colonial

**Core pattern:** corporations are *quasi-states* by charter.

* **Sovereignty model:** “the company owns the map.”
* **Primary terrain:** sea lanes, forts, ports, spice/silver/enslaved labor routes.
* **Weapons:** company navies/armies, private diplomacy, monopoly charters, plantation systems.

## What makes it a corporate war

* **Belligerents are firms with state-like power:** Entities like the East India Company or the VOC possessed their own armed forces and minted their own currency.
* **War aims are concessions + monopolies + extraction corridors:** The goal was exclusive rights to trade routes and resources, not necessarily political governance of the population beyond what was needed for extraction.
* **States provide legitimacy; companies provide violence and governance:** The state granted the charter, but the company executed the will of the state (and its shareholders) on the ground.

## End-state / Transition Driver
The modern nation-state and industrial capacity eventually outgrew charter firms. “Company rule” became politically unstable (e.g., the Indian Rebellion of 1857) and was folded into formal imperial state systems.
