  The four eras of corporate warfare, from Charter-Colonialism to Technofeudalism, defining conflicts where firms act as primary strategic actors to secure market control, resources, and enclosed ecosystems.

## What counts as a Corporate War

A conflict deserves the label **Corporate War** when **firms (or firm-blocs)** are the main strategic actors and most of these are true:

* **Primary belligerents are firms**, not states.
* **War aims are corporate**: market control, resource rights, IP, chokepoints, compute, logistics—*not* annexation or ideology.
* **Force is organized as corporate capability**: private military, security, contractors, deniable proxies, sabotage teams, cyber units.
* **State power is subordinated**: states act as captured regulators, contracted muscle, or “legal cover,” rather than the principal driver.
* **Theaters look corporate**: ports, undersea cables, satellites, fabs, shipping, data centers, standards bodies, payment rails, app stores.
* **Victory conditions are corporate**: ownership, exclusion, collapse of rivals, enforced dependency, closed ecosystems.

## Key terms

* **Belligerents**: the real drivers of strategy and escalation (who is actually fighting).
* **Strategic terrain**: what “ground” is being controlled (routes, resources, standards, platforms, compute, etc.).
* **Coercion**: how pressure is applied (violence, coups, debt, lawfare, lock-in, deplatforming, etc.).
* **Chokepoint**: a narrow dependency corridor others must pass through (shipping lanes, ports, app stores, identity rails).
* **Enclosure**: converting a commons into gated access under private rules (land → concessions → markets → platforms).
* **Private law**: rules enforced by private entities (contracts, ToS, algorithmic enforcement) that govern participation.

# The Four Corporate Wars

## [First Corporate War: Charter-Colonial](/lore/first-corporate-war/)
*(approx. 1600–1857)*

**Core pattern:** corporations are *quasi-states* by charter.
The era where corporations acted as quasi-states by charter, controlling sea lanes and resources through company navies and monopoly rights.

## [Second Corporate War: Banana-Republic](/lore/second-corporate-war/)
*(approx. 1890–1970)*

**Core pattern:** firms don’t need to *be* states; they can **capture** them.
The era where firms captured states to serve as proxies for resource extraction, using coups and private security to maintain control.

## [Third Corporate War: Neoliberalism](/lore/third-corporate-war/)
*(approx. 1980–2010)*

**Core pattern:** the firm rules by **standards + supply chains + finance**, not flags.
The era where firms ruled by standards, supply chains, and finance, enforcing market access and privatization through systemic coercion.

## [Fourth Corporate War: Technofeudalism](/lore/fourth-corporate-war/)
*(approx. 2008–Present)*

**Core pattern:** enclosure returns, but it’s **digital**: identity, attention, compute, data, discovery, and distribution become “land.”
The current era of digital enclosure where identity, attention, and compute are the new land, and firms control the means of participation.
