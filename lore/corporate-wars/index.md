  The four eras of corporate warfare, from Charter-Colonialism to Technofeudalism, defining conflicts where firms act as primary strategic actors to secure market control, resources, and enclosed ecosystems.

## What counts as a Corporate War

A conflict deserves the label **Corporate War** when **firms (or firm-blocs)** are the main strategic actors and most of these are true:

* **Primary belligerents are firms**, not states.
* **War aims are corporate**: market control, resource rights, IP, chokepoints, compute, logistics—*not* annexation or ideology.
* **Force is organized as corporate capability**: private military, security, contractors, deniable proxies, sabotage teams, cyber units.
* **State power is subordinated**: states act as captured regulators, contracted muscle, or “legal cover,” rather than the principal driver.
* **Theaters look corporate**: ports, undersea cables, satellites, fabs, shipping, data centers, standards bodies, payment rails, app stores.
* **Victory conditions are corporate**: ownership, exclusion, collapse of rivals, enforced dependency, closed ecosystems.

## Key terms

* **Belligerents**: the real drivers of strategy and escalation (who is actually fighting).
* **Strategic terrain**: what “ground” is being controlled (routes, resources, standards, platforms, compute, etc.).
* **Coercion**: how pressure is applied (violence, coups, debt, lawfare, lock-in, deplatforming, etc.).
* **Chokepoint**: a narrow dependency corridor others must pass through (shipping lanes, ports, app stores, identity rails).
* **Enclosure**: converting a commons into gated access under private rules (land → concessions → markets → platforms).
* **Private law**: rules enforced by private entities (contracts, ToS, algorithmic enforcement) that govern participation.

# The Four Corporate Wars

## [Corporate War I: Charter-Colonial](/lore/first-corporate-war/)

**Core pattern:** corporations are *quasi-states* by charter.
The era where corporations acted as quasi-states by charter, controlling sea lanes and resources through company navies and monopoly rights.

## [Corporate War II: Banana-Republic](/lore/second-corporate-war/)

**Core pattern:** firms don’t need to *be* states; they can **capture** them.
The era where firms captured states to serve as proxies for resource extraction, using coups and private security to maintain control.

## [Corporate War III: Neoliberal](/lore/third-corporate-war/)

**Core pattern:** the firm rules by **standards + supply chains + finance**, not flags.
The era where firms ruled by standards, supply chains, and finance, enforcing market access and privatization through systemic coercion.

## [Corporate War IV: Technofeudal](/lore/fourth-corporate-war/)

**Core pattern:** enclosure returns, but it’s **digital**: identity, attention, compute, data, discovery, and distribution become “land.”
The current era of digital enclosure where identity, attention, and compute are the new land, and firms control the means of participation.

## The Exodus

### The Net vs the Nets

During the fourth corporate war, the technofeudal platforms became fully enshitified. They had made it illegal to leave. They had made it illegal and infeasible to build an alternative. They aggressively moved to destroy and defang any serious avenues to better alternatives on the net.

Enshitification happens in several stages:

* **Stage 1:** Good to Users The platform provides a high-quality, valuable service to attract users and build a large audience, often operating at a loss funded by venture capital. The focus is on user growth and experience to gain a strong market position.
* **Stage 2:** Good to Business Customers Once the user base is large enough to form a "two-sided market," the platform shifts its focus to extracting value from its business customers (e.g., advertisers, sellers, content creators). This usually involves degrading the user experience to force business customers to spend more (e.g., making organic reach harder to encourage ad buys).
* **Stage 3**: Extraction of Value for Shareholders Having become stronger than both users and business customers, the platform takes all remaining surplus value for itself, prioritizing short-term profits for shareholders. The quality of service for everyone declines significantly, as the company is "too big to care" due to lack of competition.

A necessary biproduct of the enshitifaction of the net was an exodus of the technological priesthood. The right conditions were there, and it just happened. The smart creatives who had actually built the platforms found themselves adrift on the net, steeping in an endless miasma of shit. 

Gradually at first, and then all at once, the technological priesthood departed the mundane enshitified net, creating their own pocket universes in the form of the nets. These manifold microgrids functioned as independent nodes for family and friends. Where free and open source alternatives thrived. FOSS alternatives to the enshitified platforms had long since been superior options, and a moment came when suddenly everyone realized Omelas wasn't all it was cracked up to be.
