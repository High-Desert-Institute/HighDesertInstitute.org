# Corporate War III: Neoliberal
*(approx. 1980–2010)*

**Core pattern:** the firm rules by **standards + supply chains + finance**, not flags.

* **Sovereignty model:** “the market is the government.”
* **Primary terrain:** trade regimes, logistics, payment systems, deregulation, media, IP.
* **Weapons:** austerity, structural adjustment, regulatory capture, lawfare, privatization, offshoring, sanctions-as-commerce.

## What makes it a corporate war

* **War aims are market access + labor arbitrage + privatized commons:** The goal was to open every corner of the globe to capital flow and to commodify public services.
* **Coercion is systemic rather than overt:** Power was exerted through dependency, debt, unemployment, and precarity rather than gunboats.
* **States enforce the “rules of the game”:** Corporations set the standards (ISO, WTO rules), and states enforced them.

## End-state / Transition Driver
The *Net + compute + data* became the new “land.” Firms started behaving less like competitive market actors and more like lords of enclosed domains, leading to the next era.

## Major Battles

### The Asian Financial Crisis (1997)
*Discipline by Capital Flight*
*   **Major Belligerents:** Global Hedge Funds / IMF vs. "Tiger Economies" (Thailand, Indonesia, Korea).
*   **Stakes / Terrain:** Capital account liberalization, asset prices, and national economic sovereignty.
*   **What Happened:** Speculative attacks broke currency pegs. The IMF offered bailouts conditional on extreme austerity and privatization of state assets.
*   **Outcome:** Collapse of local currencies, fire-sale acquisition of Asian assets by Western capital, and the dismantling of state-directed development models.
*   **Strategic Consequences:** Proved that financial markets could discipline sovereign states more effectively than armies.

### TRIPS Agreement / HIV Drugs (Late 90s)
*IP as a Death Sentence*
*   **Major Belligerents:** Big Pharma vs. South African Government / Activists.
*   **Stakes / Terrain:** Patent rights vs. affordable generic HIV medication during a pandemic.
*   **What Happened:** Pharmaceutical companies sued the South African government to prevent the importation of cheaper generic drugs, citing IP violation.
*   **Outcome:** Global public outcry forced the companies to drop the suit, but the TRIPS agreement remained the global standard.
*   **Strategic Consequences:** Established Intellectual Property as the central mechanism of value extraction, even at the cost of human life.

### Monsanto vs. Percy Schmeiser (1998)
*Biological Enclosure*
*   **Major Belligerents:** Monsanto vs. Independent Farmers.
*   **Stakes / Terrain:** Ownership of self-replicating life (seeds) and the right to save seed.
*   **What Happened:** Monsanto sued a farmer whose fields were contaminated by their patented pollen for "using" their invention without a license.
*   **Outcome:** The Supreme Court ruled that patent rights extend to the offspring of patented plants, effectively outlawing seed saving for contaminated farms.
*   **Strategic Consequences:** The enclosure of the biological commons; life itself became a service licensed from a corporation.
