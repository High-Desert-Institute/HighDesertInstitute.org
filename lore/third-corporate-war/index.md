# Corporate War III: Neoliberal

**Core pattern:** the firm rules by **standards + supply chains + finance**, not flags.

* **Sovereignty model:** “the market is the government.”
* **Primary terrain:** trade regimes, logistics, payment systems, deregulation, media, IP.
* **Weapons:** austerity, structural adjustment, regulatory capture, lawfare, privatization, offshoring, sanctions-as-commerce.

## What makes it a corporate war

* **War aims are market access + labor arbitrage + privatized commons:** The goal was to open every corner of the globe to capital flow and to commodify public services.
* **Coercion is systemic rather than overt:** Power was exerted through dependency, debt, unemployment, and precarity rather than gunboats.
* **States enforce the “rules of the game”:** Corporations set the standards (ISO, WTO rules), and states enforced them.

## End-state / Transition Driver
The *Net + compute + data* became the new “land.” Firms started behaving less like competitive market actors and more like lords of enclosed domains, leading to the next era.
