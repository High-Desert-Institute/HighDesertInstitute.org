# Corporate War IV: Technofeudal

**Core pattern:** enclosure returns, but it’s **digital**: identity, attention, compute, data, discovery, and distribution become “land.”

* **Sovereignty model:** “you don’t own things; you access them under a lord’s terms.”
* **Primary terrain:** app stores, clouds, model weights, chips, undersea cables, identity/payment rails, platforms, algorithmic discovery.
* **Weapons:** lock-in, API tolls, subscriptionization, surveillance, deplatforming, compute rationing, walled gardens, interoperability denial.

## What makes it a corporate war

* **Firms control the *means of participation*:** Identity, distribution, and speech visibility are controlled by private platforms. To exist digitally is to be a tenant.
* **Exit costs are engineered:** Network effects, closed standards, and proprietary ecosystems make leaving a platform prohibitively expensive or socially isolating.
* **“Private law” governs daily life:** Terms of Service (ToS) and algorithmic enforcement regulate behavior more directly and frequently than public law.

## Current Status
This is the ongoing conflict of our time, where the battle is for control over the digital infrastructure that underpins reality itself.
