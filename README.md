# HighDesertInstitute.org
Our public website


The idea is to start by recreating the structure of the previous website, and then point the DNS servers to this new static version so that anyone can submit edits or updates or new pages related to the projects they're working on. And then the website can become a shared repository of all the projects we are working on, where we can all help each other and anyone in the world can contribute to the work.

This website is not yet live at [highdesertinstitute.org](https://highdesertinstitute.org). It is currently only live at [high-desert-institute.github.io/HighDesertInstitute.org](https://high-desert-institute.github.io/HighDesertInstitute.org/).


## Some notes on how Jekyll works and how to edit pages...

For any directory in this repository, there should be an index.md. This file can be [edited as markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax). You can preview your changes in the preview tab, or edit the file locally on your machine before submitting a pull request. A member of the team will then review and approve your changes before they go live on the main public site.

There should also be a readme.md which contains devops details such as what you're reading now. This information is not necessary of helpful on the public website; only for people who are editing the public website.

If you would like to help with the process of reviewing pull requests, please reach out to CJ in the DevOps channel of the discord.


## Recommended Editing Setup

- Download github desktop for free. This allows you to stage your changes and submit them all at once.
- Download vs code to edit the pages. This has good integration for copilot which will help a lot for debugging and completions.

TODO put together a good self-hosted, open-source alternative set of recommendations running completions with something like QwQ-32b instead.
