blurb: "An expert in organizational leadership, Joe has spent time at traditional intentional communities including volunteering at both The Garden and Pirate’s Cove, but he is a maverick thinker who focuses on how these processes and systems could work better. This vital critical lens is the central value proposition of HDI; thinking about things in new ways and always considering how our systems and processes could work better."
