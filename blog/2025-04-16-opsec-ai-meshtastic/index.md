That power is gone now, meaning the would-be totalitarians and oligarchs have very little ability to actually do anything.
  - They are trying to get attention by creating drama and commiting egregiously illegal violations of the rights of people in minority communities, but they have virtually no power to do any of what they want on any kind of widespread scale.
  - "Justice can not sleep forever."
