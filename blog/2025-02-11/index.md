        -   A secretary is elected to take meeting minutes and share them.
            -   Secretary maintains a list of meeting attendants and active members
                -   Active members are members who have participated in at least two of the last three meetings
            -   Secretary should be reporting on any cash flows and the state of their balances during the meeting and in the minutes
        -   Guild meetings are held as needed. The frequency and scheduling of additional meetings are determined by the guild's active members, based on the guild's current projects, initiatives, and requirements.
        -   Meetings are announced via substack, discord, and elsewhere as appropriate
        -   51% quorum requirement
            -   51% of active members must be present to hold a vote
        -   Vote by 51% majority of the quorum is required to adopt decisions
        -   Guilds can vote on
            -   Changing their voting process, quorum requirements, additional rules, etc.
            -   How to spend the funds they raise (within legal and bylaw requirements)
            -   New projects and initiatives that fall within the guild’s purview
                -   The board will review all new initiatives. If there are significant new funds, land requirements, etc, the board may have additional requirements or feedback.                    
        -   It is our intention that guilds should be project-focused working groups that are not necessarily limited to the land projects of the High Desert Institute. These groups are intended to bring people together to solve specific problems, here or elsewhere. It is our intention that these guilds should ideally eventually grow and become autonomous organizations tackling the problems at larger scales for communities everywhere.
