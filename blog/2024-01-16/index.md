# 2024-01-16: Board Meeting Minutes

We are fundraising on GoFundMe. Help us build a foundation for the survival of humanity by donating what you can…

- We are creating a substack (email newsletter) where people can subscribe (and optionally pay whatever they want monthly) to get all the updates and recap of everything that’s going on.
- We discussed the radio telescope project and nuclear fusion reactor project which are moving along nicely.
- We are creating a discord which will be organized into whimsically named guilds like Pyromancers’ Guild (Fire stuff) Artificer’s Guild (building stuff) etc. 
    - Some more guild name ideas from AI: 
        - Water team: Hydrologist’s Guild
        - Food team: Gastronomers’ Guild
        - Health and Wellness people: Elixerists’ Guild
        - Education and knowledge sharing: Lorekeepers’ Guild
        - Energy: Energimancers’ Guild
        - Livestock and animals: Faunamancers’ Guild
        - Gardening and permaculture: Floramages’ Guild or Floramancers’ Guild
        - Entertainment and leisure: Mirth Mages Guild or Mages of Mirth Guild
        - Transportation and travel: Pathfinders’ League or Wanderlust Wizards
- Julia and Joe are going to create and lead some kind of collaborative community design process for the seed kitchen/ lodge/ central structure that will be the first project we do on the new land.
- Julia had the idea that the guilds could begin separate fundraisers for their specific projects even before the current land purchase fundraiser is complete.
- CJ met with founder of the djedi religion. They are super excited about working together to build a non-denominational, non-proselytizing, humanist space for quiet reflection and meditation which is inclusive of the many faiths and mystical traditions people may be a part of.
- Julia had the idea that setting a lower fundraising goal might make it easier to fundraise larger sums based on our past work with the pirate’s cove fundraiser. We are changing the fundraising goal from $499,000 to $49,900.
- The final financial approvals are pending so we should start getting access to the money from the fundraiser soon and then we can start the incorporation process which will also be something we create content to teach people about this process.
## Join us on Discord!
We are launching a discussion forum for all the guilds and projects. Join us to contribute to the projects with your ideas and feedback, or as a volunteer at the land.
