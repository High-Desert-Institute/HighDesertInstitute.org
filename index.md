## What We’re Working On

A group of seasoned experts from the off-grid community-building world are fundraising to create a series of new land projects in the high deserts of the southwest. These outposts will be centers for permaculture and mutual aid, designed to build a foundation for the survival of humanity.

These new land projects will facilitate research, development, and distribution of free, open-source solutions to basic human needs like housing and off-grid infrastructure.

None of us are getting paid — every dollar goes to the mission. The entire process will be completely transparent and open source. Every dollar donated makes a huge difference!

## The Library

HDI will publish a vast, free, open-source library containing everything we learn, as well as many other sources we’ve collected on how to live off-grid well. This started as a request from a community we helped build. The idea is to enable off-grid communities to host their own private internet with libraries of useful knowledge.

---

## Guest Researchers

HDI will sponsor guest researchers to conduct vital work on sustainable, off-grid infrastructure and housing. We’ll publish all research in our open-source library for anyone to use freely.

---

## Model Communities

We will build model communities to demonstrate best practices and appropriate technologies for solving off-grid human infrastructure challenges. These communities will be open to the public.

## Upcoming Land Projects

### High Ground

We are currently fundraising for High Ground — a project focused on free, open-source building plans for accessible, affordable, sustainable, up-to-code off-grid homes.

### Sky Spring

Sky Spring will focus on free, open-source, sustainable infrastructure — offering the best solutions to basic off-grid infrastructure needs.

### [Pirates’ Cove](https://www.peoplesprojectearth.org)

A 16-acre off-grid community on Dale Hollow Lake, Tennessee. Hundreds helped build this project after a successful GoFundMe campaign in 2022.

### The Garden

The Garden was where many involved in HDI first met. It inspired our current work. Out of it came the *Radical Raccoon How-To Guide* and the dream of HDI in the southwest.
